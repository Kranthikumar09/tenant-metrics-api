## Next recommended PR

**PR-036R — Add CSRF-protected browser logout**

- Capacity: S
- Why next: ADR-002 requires CSRF-protected server-side logout, while the current security configuration still disables logout; this is the next smallest session-lifecycle gap after absolute expiry
- Main dependency: PR-025R, PR-035R, and ADR-002
- In scope: POST-only browser logout, CSRF enforcement, PostgreSQL session invalidation, session-cookie clearing, safe response behavior, and integration tests
- Out of scope: Angular logout UI, identity-provider end-session calls, membership/account lifecycle revocation, production IdP configuration, machine API-key behavior, Redis, MongoDB, or new infrastructure

## Later candidates

Select the next candidate after PR-036R using the product contract and remaining milestone risks; do not pre-commit to learned-model or deployment work.
