Small PRs only. Do not implement the next item until it is approved.

## Next recommended PR

**PR-031R — Paginate the current prediction list**

- Capacity: S
- Why next: the console currently stops at the first 50 current predictions even though the tenant-safe backend cursor already exists; a bounded Load more interaction makes larger tenant portfolios usable
- Main dependency: PR-028R
- In scope: retain `next_cursor`, request later current-prediction pages through the same-origin session, append non-duplicate accounts, and expose accessible loading/end/error states for a Load more control
- Out of scope: history pagination controls, backend API changes, infinite scrolling, filtering/sorting, learned-model training, customer-facing explanations, production deployment, Redis, MongoDB

## Later candidates

**PR-032R — Paginate account score history** is a later S-sized candidate after current-list pagination.
